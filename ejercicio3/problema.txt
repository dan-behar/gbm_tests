You are standing on the OX-axis at point 0 and you want to move to an integer point x > 0.
You can make several jumps. Suppose you're currently at point y (y may be negative) and
jump for the k-th time.
You can:
    i. either jump to the point y+k or
    ii. jump to the point yâˆ’1.
    
What is the minimum number of jumps you need to reach the point x?
