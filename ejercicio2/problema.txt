The Formula 1 season consists of a series of races, known as Grand Prix, organized by the
International Federation of Automobile (FIA). The results of each Grand Prix are combined to
determine Pilots\' World Championship. More specifically, for each race some points are
distributed to pilots, depending on their classification in the race. At the end of the season, the
pilot who has earned the most points is declared the World Champion.

Formula 1 organizers change constantly the competition rules, aiming to provide more excitement to
fans. One rule modified for the 2010 season was the distribution of points in each Grand Prix.

The change in the scoring system led to much speculation about what would have been the effect to
the World Championship in the past if the new score had been used. For example, would Lewis
Hamilton have been champion in 2008, considering he and Felipe Massa were separated by just one
point? To end the speculation, FIA hired you to write a program that, given the results of each race of
a season determines the World Champion for different scoring systems.
